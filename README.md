# DataSpark-Illuminating-Insights-for-Global-Electronics
# Project Overview
  This project focuses on a comprehensive data pipeline involving cleaning, merging, analyzing, and visualizing customer, sales, exchange rate, and store data. The aim is to uncover actionable insights to improve operational efficiency, marketing strategies, and overall business growth for Global Electronics.

# Collecting All the Files
Organize all relevant CSV files (e.g., customers, sales, exchange rates, stores) in a single folder.
Ensure the Python script is executed in the same directory for seamless file access.

# Data Cleaning
 Tools Used: Python, Pandas
  Reading the Data:
    Imported all CSV files into DataFrames using Pandas.
  Handling Missing Values:
    Identified and addressed null values using appropriate imputation methods.
  Data Type Conversion:
    Standardized columns to their correct data types (e.g., dates, integers, floats) for consistency and compatibility.
   
# Data Merging
 Tools Used: Python, Pandas
  Merging Datasets:
    Consolidated all cleaned datasets into a single DataFrame.
    Used the Pandas merge() function with the inner join method to maintain data integrity.

# Uploading Data to SQL
 Tools Used: SQLAlchemy, Python
  Connecting to the SQL Database:
     Established a connection to the database named capstone using SQLAlchemy.
  Pushing Data to SQL:
     Uploaded the final cleaned and merged DataFrame into corresponding SQL tables for further analysis.

# Data Analysis with SQL
 Tools Used: SQL
   Writing SQL Queries:
    Created custom queries to analyze various aspects, including:
    Customer demographics and trends.
    Sales performance and patterns.
    Product popularity and categories.
    Store performance and geographic insights.
    
# Data Visualization with Power BI
  Tools Used: Power BI
  Uploading Queries:
  Imported SQL query results into Power BI for visualization.
  Creating Visualizations:
  Designed interactive dashboards and reports to present findings, enabling stakeholders to 
  make data-driven decisions effectively.

# Deliverables
  SQL Database: Fully structured database with cleaned and merged data.
  SQL Queries: Optimized queries for in-depth data analysis.
  Power BI Dashboards: Interactive visualizations for actionable insights.
  Python Scripts: Code for data cleaning, merging, and SQL upload processes.

# Tools and Technologies
  Programming Languages: Python (Pandas, SQLAlchemy)
  Database Management: SQL
  Visualization Tools: Power BI

# How to Run the Project
  Place all CSV files in the same folder as the Python script.
  Execute the Python script to clean, merge, and upload data to the SQL database.
  Use the provided SQL queries for analysis.
  Visualize the results by importing SQL outputs into Power BI.
